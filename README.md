## Description

AncestorLens is a full-stack web application that addresses the unique needs of African genealogy by focusing on features that existing Western genealogy tools often overlook. The platform empowers families to preserve their cultural heritage through:

- **Interactive Family Trees** with photos, bios, and relationships
- **Burial Site Mapping** using GPS coordinates to record ancestral locations
- **Oral Storytelling Archive** for preserving folklore, ancestor stories, and cultural traditions
- **Privacy Controls** with secure authentication and role-based sharing

Originally targeting Nigeria due to its strong oral history traditions, AncestorLens is designed to scale across Africa.
